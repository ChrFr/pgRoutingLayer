About pgRoutingLayer pgRoutingLayer is a plugin for QGIS that serves as a GUI for pgRouting - a popular routing solution for PostGIS databases. What this plugin currently does Introduction Layer Naming Convention Main buttons Functions pgRoutingLayer currently supports the following functions: pgr_alphaShape pgr_astar pgr_bdAstar pgr_bdDijkstra pgr_dijkstra pgr_drivingDistance pgr_KSP pgr_trsp(edge) pgr_trsp(vertex) pgr_trspViaEdges pgr_trspViaVertices Please check the pgRouting documentation for detailed descriptons: https://docs.pgrouting.org Installation This plugin can be installed using the QGIS Plugin Manager. You will have to enable \"experimental\" plugins. Dependencies This plugin runs only with QGIS 3.x and Python 3. pgRouting v2.x up and running to use this plugin. Additionally, QGIS needs python-psycopg2 installed to be able to connect to the database.
