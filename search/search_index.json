About pgRoutingLayer pgRoutingLayer is a plugin for QGIS that serves as a GUI for pgRouting - a popular routing solution for PostGIS databases. What this plugin currently does PgRoutingLayer currently supports the following functions: Dijkstra Astar bdDijkstra bdAstar KSP Trsp_vertex Trsp_edge Trsp_via_vertices Trsp_via_edges DrivingDistance Alphashape Please check the pgRouting documentation for detailed descriptons: http://docs.pgrouting.org Installation This plugin can be installed using the QGIS Plugin Manager. You will have to enable \"experimental\" plugins. Dependencies This plugin runs only with QGIS 3.x and Python 3. pgRouting v2.x up and running to use this plugin. Additionally, QGIS needs python-psycopg2 installed to be able to connect to the database.
